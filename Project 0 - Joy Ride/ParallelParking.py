# # Joy Ride - Part 3: Parallel Parking
# In this section you will write a function that implements the correct sequence of steps required to parallel park a vehicle.
# 
# **Note** for this segment the vehicle's maximum speed has been set to just over 4 mph. This should make parking a little easier.

# # Submitting this Project!
# Your parallel park function is "correct" when:
# 
# 1. Your car doesn't hit any other cars.
# 2. Your car stops completely inside of the right lane.
# 
# Once you've got it working, it's time to submit. Submit by pressing the `SUBMIT` button at the lower right corner of this page.
