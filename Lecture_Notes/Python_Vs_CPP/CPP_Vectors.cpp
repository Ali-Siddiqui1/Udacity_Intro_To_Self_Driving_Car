// CPP vectors are just like Python list but CPP also has list which but doesn't work the same way as python does
// CPP list and Python list are both in family structure called sequence containers. These containers allows us to store values in series and then access those values
//
// include file from standard library
#include<vector>
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
// Declaring CPP Vectors
typedef variablename;
// also need to declare what kind of values will go inside the vector such as integer, char, float, string etc

int main(){
    std::cout<char> charactervectorvariable;
    std::cout<int> intvectorvariable;
    std::cout<float>floatvectorvariable;
    std::cout<double>doublevectorvariable;
    // more generally you can declare a vector with
    //std::vector <<datatype<<variablename;

    return 0;
}

// Practice CPP Vector Library
//
// import the vector library
#include<vector>
#include<iostream>
//  write a program that declares three integer vectors named:
int main(){
    // vector 1
    std::vector<int> vector1;
    // vector 2
    std::vector<int> vector2;
    //vector 3
    std::vector<int> vector3;

    return 0;
